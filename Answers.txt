What's a RubyGem and why would you use one?
- RubyGem is module or library that can easily be used on every ruby projects
it is often written in a way that makes some portion of work a lot easier and faster
by allowing developers to perform tasks with simple instance of code.
What's the difference between lazy and eager loading?
- Eagar loading fetch is fully fetched when its parent is fetched so when
class University has List<Course>, and on Eagar loading fetch when University
is fetched then Course is also fetched immediately.
However in Lazy loading, content of University is fetched only when it is accessed
from external sources.
What's the difference between the CREATE TABLE and INSERT INTO SQL statements?
- CREATE TABLE creates brand new database table from scratch
INSERT INTO inserts row into existing or given table
What's the difference between extend and include? When would you use one or the other?
- Include allows class to utilize the methods inside of module when class is instantiated
but extend gives an access to the method to class.
In persistence.rb, why do the save methods need to be instance (vs. class) methods?
Instance method requires class to be instantiated before it can be used whereas
class method can just be called with class name. For the case of persistence,
save operation belongs to the instance of that particular class therefore save
method is only valid when there is a instance.
Given the Jar-Jar Binks example earlier, what is the final SQL query
in persistence.rb's save! method?
UPDATE table
SET value = 50
WHERE id = 1;
AddressBook's entries instance variable no longer returns anything.
We'll fix this in a later checkpoint. What changes will we need to make?
